            When browser encounters a script tag, it halts page rendering and all other downloads. The JavaScript files are downloaded one after the other. Till all the download is complete the page is not rendered.
            <p>Observe that the DOM update triggered by the scripts happen only after all scripts have downloaded and finished execution.
               The good part is that the order of script execution is maintained.

                Sidebar (width=400, height not specified).

                    The ordering of the controls inside a dockpanel is important. In this example the Header is put first, then the Footer and then this Sidebar.
                    Because of this arrangement, the Sidebar takes the remaining available height after Header and Footer.
                    If the Sidebar is added immediately after Header, it will take the full available height after the Header till the bottom of the page and the Footer will overlap
                    on top of it.
